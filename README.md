Hello! Thanks for taking a look at my work. I'm new in this space and am currently on the journey of being a self-taught data analyst. Currently 
incorporating my knowledge in financial analytics into SQL, Tableau, and Python. As soon as I build more of a stable foundation for myself,
hopefully I can help collaborate on projects that interest me. 

Have a good one!
